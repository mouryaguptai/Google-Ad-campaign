## Campaign Overview
This campaign involved analyzing the effectiveness of Google Ads in promoting the academyâ€™s services such as preschool, weekend childcare, and after-school programs. Key performance metrics included ad quality score improvement, click-through rates, and overall campaign impressions.

## Goals and Social Impact
The primary goal was to increase enrollment and raise awareness about the academy's unique educational approach, which integrates STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) into early childhood education.

## Future Directions
Based on the campaign data, future efforts will focus on refining keyword strategies, enhancing ad quality, and possibly expanding the geographical target area to optimize ad reach and effectiveness.
